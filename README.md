osgPlanes
=========
This program is on very early stage of the development.
I was always keen on 3D graphics and my work is directly
related to ATC, flight trajectory managment and so on.
So I've started to learn OSG and osgEarth.

The idea is to visualize air traffic on the real osgEarth,
to show vertical profiles and other information about
each plane in the sky.

I create it to my needs, so here you can see only source files
without models, *.earth files or flight data.

Currently osgPlanes supports MySQL database and *.txt files
of certain format as flight data sources.
In future I plan to add UDP/TCP support.

You can find a video, demonstrating previous version of
osgPlanes, here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeM9MZiLqhY
