Here is the description of file format used as trajectory container.
Frequency should be 10 seconds. Other points are interpolated in the program.
Delimiter is 1 space symbol - " ".

Description:
  0 - t - seconds of flight starting from 0
  1 - alt - altitude of the plane in ft (m/0.3048)
  2 - TAS - true air speed of the plane in m/s
  3 - psi - aircraft heading in degrees [0;360]
  4 - currentWPT  - current waypoint number. Switch from 3 to 4 means that plane passed 3rd waypoint. Each distinct figure is a waypoint.
  5 - Lat - latitude of the plane in degrees [-90;90]
  6 - Lon - longitude of the plane in degrees [-180;180]
- 7 - Vx  - plane speed in the projection on the axis X in m/s
- 8 - Vy  - plane speed in the projection on the axis Y in m/s
- 9 - windW - module of the wind velocity vector in m/s
- 10  - windPsi - heading of the wind velocity vector in degrees [0;360]
  11  - M - Mach number of the plane
- 12  - GS  - ground speed
- 13  - dPsi  - not needed (internal parameter for trajectory calculation)
  14  - alpha - angle of attack in degrees
  15  - theta - pitch angle in degrees
  16  - gamma - roll angle in degrees

Parameters marked with '-' in the beginning are not planned to be used. Just use 0 to fill them.
Currently osgPlanes uses 7 parameters:
  t;
  alt, Lat, Lon - to position plane on Earth;
  alpha, theta, gamma - to rotate plane;
