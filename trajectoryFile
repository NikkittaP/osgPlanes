Here is the description of file format used as trajectory container.
Frequency should be 10 seconds. Other points are interpolated in the program.
Delimiter is 1 space symbol - " ".

- 7 - Vx  - plane speed in the projection on the axis X
- 8 - Vy  - plane speed in the projection on the axis Y
- 9 - windW - module of the wind velocity vector in m/s
- 10  - windPsi - heading of the wind velocity vector in degrees [0;360]
  11  - M - Mach number of the plane
  12  - GS  - ground speed
- 13  - dPsi  - not needed
